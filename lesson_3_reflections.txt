When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
when i am collaborating with others, when i need them in another place with another computer

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because the commit maybe done by another person and i don't agree with it, so i don't want it on m computer

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
Forks are copies of a repository from github another account to github my account.
Clones are copies of a repository from github to my computer or from my computer to my computer.
Branches are parts of the history in a repository, as master branch or athors. It exists on computer or on github. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
to be able to work on the last version when i am not online.
